If using OpenCV for more advanced enhancements, import `cv2` and convert the PIL Image to a NumPy array for processing, then convert it back to a PIL Image.\n",

        "5. For large images, divide them into smaller, manageable tiles. Decide on a tile size (e.g., 500x500 pixels) and a stride (e.g., 400 pixels for overlapping tiles or 500 pixels for non-overlapping). Generate a list of cropped image tiles for each large image.\n",
        "6. Create a new data structure (e.g., a list of dictionaries) to store the original page number, the processed full image (if not tiled), or the individual image tiles along with their coordinates (e.g., top-left corner) for reconstruction if tiling was applied. Include the `extracted_text` from the original image in this new structure as well."
